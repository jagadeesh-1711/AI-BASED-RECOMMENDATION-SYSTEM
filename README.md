## üìå Description

This application is a user-based recommendation engine implemented using the **Apache Mahout** library. The engine reads user-item interaction data from a CSV file and generates recommendations for a specified user.

The core logic uses the **Pearson Correlation Similarity** algorithm to compute user-user similarity and identifies the nearest neighbors using Mahout‚Äôs `NearestNUserNeighborhood`. Based on the neighborhood, the system recommends the top-N items to the user.

This project is ideal for demonstrating how collaborative filtering works and how to integrate machine learning-based recommenders in Java applications. It is lightweight, modular, and scalable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 8 or above)** ‚Äì Main programming language
- **Apache Mahout (v0.9)** ‚Äì Machine learning library for collaborative filtering
- **Maven** ‚Äì Build and dependency management
- **SLF4J** ‚Äì Logging (used internally by Mahout)
- **CSV** ‚Äì Dataset format (userID, itemID, rating)

---

## üíº Where This is Used

- **E-commerce platforms** ‚Äì Product recommendations
- **Streaming services** ‚Äì Movie or music recommendations
- **E-learning portals** ‚Äì Course suggestions
- **Social media** ‚Äì Friend or content recommendations
- **Retail** ‚Äì Personalized promotions and offers

This engine can serve as a foundation for more advanced recommenders using hybrid approaches (e.g., combining content-based + collaborative).
